* Caputring my decisions and findings below...

# Ideas
Thinking through my capstone, here are some of my original ideas:
1. ETSY: Scrape the Etsy API to determine which features of an Etsy profile have the best sales, and are certain types makers more likely to sell more and/or be followed/favorited
- Resource: https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/api_basics  
-- compare people who joined at the same time
-- possible that this is too complicated

2. Look at food waste data by state/city and compare with cities with composting services, and grocery stores in the state
Audience: government
-- compost - Zero Hunger Zero Waste (Kroger)

3. CO GLASSDOOR SALARIES: 
Look at salary information from 2020-2022 and determine if Colorado's Equal Pay for Equal Work Act has impacted salary ranges since the law went into effect in January 2021. I'd like to uncover which job titles, industries, types of corporations, had the highest and lowest salary changes in the state. (Data should identify if the job is full time or part time.)

4. Look at who says what on parks n rec - see if each character can be defined by certain words or phrases

5. Ask Brandee if she has data - would be publicly accessible

NOTES:
* Good website to check out: https://www.programmableweb.com/category/community/apis?category=20135
* what problems can be solved with this data


START NARROWLY & then  expand
1. What is your problem statement?  What will you actually be doing?
2. Who is your audience?  Why will they care?
3. What is your success metric?  How will you know if you are actually solving the problem in a useful way?
4. What is your data source?  What format is your data in?  How much cleaning and munging will be required?
5. What are potential challenges or obstacles and how will you mitigate them?
6. Is this a reasonable project given the time constraints that you have?
